### Time to Create a Basic CRUD API

Creating a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API with Express.js is typically quick and straightforward. You can have a basic API up and running in less than an hour, particularly if you leverage tools like Postman for testing. Here’s a skeleton example:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

let items = [];

// Create
app.post('/items', (req, res) => {
  items.push(req.body);
  res.status(201).send(req.body);
});

// Read
app.get('/items', (req, res) => {
  res.send(items);
});

// Update
app.put('/items/:id', (req, res) => {
  items[req.params.id] = req.body;
  res.send(req.body);
});

// Delete
app.delete('/items/:id', (req, res) => {
  items.splice(req.params.id, 1);
  res.status(204).send();
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

### Creating an API with Basic Authentication

let items = [];

// Create
router.post('/items', (ctx) => {
  items.push(ctx.request.body);
  ctx.status = 201;
  ctx.body = ctx.request.body;
});

// Read
router.get('/items', (ctx) => {
  ctx.body = items;
});

// Update
router.put('/items/:id', (ctx) => {
  items[ctx.params.id] = ctx.request.body;
  ctx.body = ctx.request.body;
});

// Delete
router.delete('/items/:id', (ctx) => {
  items.splice(ctx.params.id, 1);
  ctx.status = 204;
});

app
  .use(bodyParser())
  .use(router.routes())
  .use(router.allowedMethods());
