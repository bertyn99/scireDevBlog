JavaScript is a programming language that enables you to create dynamically changing content on web pages. You can use JavaScript to validate form input, create image rollovers, and to open and close windows.

JavaScript is easy to learn for beginners and has lots of resources for more advanced programmers. It is a cross-platform, interpreted language that is also known as a scripting language for webpages. In addition to being used for Client-side development, JavaScript can also be used for Server-side development.

The JavaScript language contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements.

## **Origin of the language javascript**

Javascript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich, who at the time was working on one of the first web browsers. He was told that he had only 10 days to design and code a prototype of a programming language that could run on the browser. His requirement was that the language should appeal to programmers, not professionals like Microsoft Visual Basic (which had at least a year of design and development from 1990 to 1991), and be interpreted for easy integration into web pages.

Javascript was originally known as Mocha then as LiveScript, but was renamed javascript when Netscape included it in their Navigator browser in order to make it more appealing to java developers. The language has come a long way since its humble beginnings - today, it is one of the most popular programming.

## Advantage and limit of javascrit

The language javascript is a widely used programming language that helps developers create interactive web applications. javascript can be used to create games, apps and websites. It’s also used to create mobile apps.

### Pros

- The language is easy to learn for beginners.
- Javascript is a versatile language that can be used for backend, frontend, and full stack development.
- It’s a quite popular language, so there is a large community of developers who can help you with your projects.
- Javascript is also well known for havings many frameworks and libraries that can help you save time and energy when coding your project.

### Con

- Javascript can be slow compared to other languages such as C++ or Java.
- Javascript is not always consistent across different browsers. This can be a problem for developers who want their code to work the same in all browsers.
- Javascript is not a compiled language, so it can be difficult to debug errors in your code.
- It's a known joke among web developers that there are so many new javascript frameworks every month that it's easy to get lost.

## Principale use case

Due to its expanding community throughout the years. Javascript has managed to break free of its restrained programming language container and go from client-side execution to server-side execution. What will be a new server-side paradigm called Node. Js was introduced to the world in 2009, freeing up JavaScript capabilities for use in backend and server-side development.
This makes JS a long-standing competitor of server-side programming languages like Java, Python, Ruby, PHP, and many more.
Currently, JavaScript is a language that can power desktop, mobile, and web apps. Additionally, it may interact with databases and be integrated into devices.

Even among developper the javascript framework are pretty popular like we can see with this [stack overflow survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-most-popular-technologies-web-frameworks-and-technologies) of 2022.
